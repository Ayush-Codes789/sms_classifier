# sms_classifier

A Machine Learning–based SMS Spam Classifier that automatically classifies text messages as Spam or Ham (Not Spam) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

The entire implementation is provided in a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) for clarity and learning purposes.

Spam messages are a common problem in mobile communication.

This project demonstrates how to build an SMS classification system using text preprocessing, feature extraction, and machine learning models.
